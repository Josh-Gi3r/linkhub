# Contributing to LinkHub

Thanks for taking the time to contribute. This is a small, focused project — keep changes tight and well-scoped.

## Getting started

1. Fork and clone the repo.
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Copy `cp .env.example .env` and fill in at least `DATABASE_URL` and `JWT_SECRET`.
4. Push the schema: `pnpm db:push`
5. Run the dev server: `pnpm dev`

## Before you open a PR

- `pnpm check` — TypeScript must pass with no errors.
- `pnpm test` — the Vitest suite must be green.
- `pnpm format` — run Prettier so the diff stays clean.

## Guidelines

- Keep PRs small and single-purpose. One change per PR.
- Match the existing code style; don't reformat unrelated files.
- Add or update tests for behavior changes (see `server/*.test.ts`).
- Don't commit secrets. `.env` is gitignored — keep it that way.
- For new env vars, document them in `.env.example`.
- For schema changes, generate a migration via `pnpm db:push` and commit the generated SQL under `drizzle/`.

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with steps to reproduce, what you expected, and what happened. Include the database and (if relevant) the storage, email, or wallet provider you're running, plus any relevant logs.
